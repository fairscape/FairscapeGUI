Getting Started: Preparation and steps The client interface contains five interactive steps for creating and publishing RO-Crates. Only authorized users are allowed to publish the RO-Crates to the FAIRSCAPE server after logging in. While RO-Crates can be created and packaged in a local machine in isolation, internet connection is required when a user is ready to connect to the server and publish them. Internet connection is required only when a user is ready to publish. The opening interface shows the following steps: Step 0: Prep Folder for RO-Crate Initialization Step 1: Initialize an RO-Crate Step 2: Register files in your RO-Crate Step 3: Review the contents of your RO-Crate Step 4: Package an RO-Crate for upload Step 5: Upload an RO-Crate Select any of these steps to begin the process. For creating a new RO-Crate, begin by moving all the data and software you'd like to package to a single folder (step 0). 2. Initializing an RO-Crate To initialize a new RO-Crate: Provide the RO-Crate Path Enter the RO-Crate Name (e.g., Example Crate) Specify the organization name from the dropdown list Enter the Project Name (e.g., CM4AI) Provide a Description (e.g., Example Crate for Demo) Add relevant Keywords (e.g., test, demo, example) The right panel shows a preview of the metadata in JSON-LD format, which updates as you fill in the form. 3. Registering Objects After initialization, a list of files will be available for registration in your RO-Crate. In this example, the files are: input_data.csv output_data.csv software.py Select a file to add metadata for each object. 4. Adding Metadata to Objects For each file, the following set of metadata must be provided: Dataset Name (e.g., input data) Author (e.g., Smith John) Version (e.g., 1.0) Date Published (e.g., 10/17/2024) Description (e.g., Example Input Dataset) Keywords (e.g., test) Data Format (e.g., CSV) 5. Completing Object Registration Once metadata are provided for all files: A green checkmark will appear next to each registered file Complete the registration step by clicking \"Done Registering\". 6. Recording Computation To record a computation: Enter the Computation Name (e.g., Example Computation) Specify the Date Created (e.g., 10/17/2024) Provide the name of who Run By the computation (e.g., Smith John) Add relevant Keywords (e.g., python) Give a Description of the computation (e.g., Simple computation) There are 4 placeholders: Available Files (registered files only) Input Datasets Output Datasets Software Used Drag and drop files from the Available Files section to the appropriate categories. 7. Previewing RO-Crate Contents The Review step allows users to examine and verify all the metadata recorded in the previous steps. It offers two viewing options: 1. Table View This view presents the RO-Crate contents in a tabular format with the following columns: Name : Displays the name or title of each item in the RO-Crate Status : Shows the current status of each item, typically \"Registered\" if properly added Type : Indicates the type of content (e.g., dataset, file, person) GUID (Globally Unique Identifier): Presents a unique identifier for each item 2. JSON-LD View This view shows the RO-Crate metadata in JSON-LD format. It provides: A machine-readable representation of the RO-Crate metadata Detailed semantic information about the relationships between items Users can switch between these views to gain different perspectives on their RO-Crate contents. Once satisfied with the review, users can proceed to the RO-Crate packaging step. 8. Packaging RO-Crate To package your RO-Crate: Verify the RO-Crate Path is correct. To package the RO-Crate: 9. Uploading RO-Crate Finally, to upload your packaged RO-Crate: Ensure you're logged in to the FAIRSCAPE ROCrate Repository. The packaged RO-Crate file name will be displayed (e.g., Test.zip). Click \"Upload RO-Crate\" to begin the upload process. Track the upload progress with the status bar! Congratulations!
